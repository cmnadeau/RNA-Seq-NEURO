This is a [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) based pipeline for RNA-seq used in the [Tumor Genome Core Analysis](http://www.tgac.nl/) housed in the [Cancer Center Amsterdam](https://www.vumc.com/departments/cancer-center-amsterdam.htm), at [Amsterdam UMC location VUmc](https://www.vumc.nl/) and part of the Department of Pathology.

The pipeline processes raw data from FastQ inputs ([FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), [Trimmomatic](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic)), aligns the reads ([STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)), generates gene counts ([featureCounts](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts/)) and performs quality-control on the results ([MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/)). Paired-end (PE) and single-end (SE) are supported.

## Installation

The pipeline is preliminary used in linux environment with conda/singularity available.

### Using Conda
### Step 1: Installing Miniconda 3
First, please open a terminal or make sure you are logged into your Linux VM. Assuming that you have a 64-bit system, on Linux, download and install Miniconda 3 with:

```
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
On MacOS X, download and install with:

```
curl https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -o Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

### Step 2: Downloading repository & creating environment

```
mkdir snakemake_RNAseq
cd snakemake_RNAseq
git clone https://github.com/tgac-vumc/RNA-seq
conda env create --name RNAseq --file env.yaml
```

### Using Singularity

The singularity container holds a virtual environment of CentOS 7 and it's available with:
```
singularity pull shub://tgac-vumc/RNA-seq
```

## Path Configuration & Running the pipeline

Before attempting to run the pipeline, please open *config.yaml*. Inside, you will encounter **Path Configuration** and **Software Options**. 

1. On **Path configuration**, first, you have to choose whether your data is PE or SE and after change the fastq path to the path where your fastq files are actually stored.
2. On **Software Options**, you will find several options that can be modified by the user. Please, have a look at it before running the pipeline. 

All the software used in the pipeline is installed by conda or executed in a wrapper. We recommend to run the pipeline from a different location than the pipeline path, like the example below:

```
snakemake -s PATH_TO_PIPELINE/Snakefile --use-conda --cores=24
```
With --use-conda option, the pipeline will create environments to run rules based on *env.yaml*. 
**Note** the pipeline assumes that *config.yaml* is available at the location where the pipeline is executed.
